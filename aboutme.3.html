            <h2>About Mimi</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Hannah but my family nickname is "Mimi". I am a 23yr old based in Punta Gorda, Florida. My passion for baking started in 2020 during the pandemic while I was off of work watching baking shows on Netflix, I figured "hey I think i could do that" and here we are! I bake cupcakes, cookies, and hope to extend my menu further with other baked goodies!</p>
            <p>In my free time besides baking I love to read thriller books and even host my own book club  with my sisters. I also love to spend time with my fiance at Downtown Kava!</p>
