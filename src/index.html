                "I recently had the pleasure of enjoying some incredible cupcakes from Mimi’s Sweets, and I can’t recommend them enough! 
                The salted caramel flavor was absolutely delicious, perfectly balanced with just the right amount of sweetness and saltiness. 
                The custom-made edible gold-colored dark chocolate giraffe toppers were not only stunning but added a delightful touch to the overall presentation.<br><br>
                What truly impressed me was how the owner took the time to incorporate our previous discussions into creating the perfect combination just for me. 
                It’s clear that Mimi’s Sweets is dedicated to both quality and customer satisfaction. 
                If you’re looking for a unique treat or a special occasion dessert, this local gem is a must-order!" - Lindsey G.

                We’ve hired Hannah on multiple occasions to make her famous cupcakes for various events. 
                Every single time her cupcakes are absolutely gorgeous and taste even better! 
                You can tell she puts her heart into each batch!<br><br>
                Her cookies are out of this world too, and dare I say she makes the best chocolate chip cookies I’ve ever had. 
                Highly recommend! - Sarah D.
